    <h3>In my opinion, the best way to have beef</h3>
    <p>
      Beef Bulgogi, an icon in Korean barbecue, perhaps the simplest way to
      prepare beef while yielding the best results. Beef Bulgogi is a simple yet
      extraordinary dish which packs an exceptionally large pallet of flavors,
      while also filling your belly. Commonly served with rice, sliced
      vegetables, and kimchi, Beef Bulgogi never misses the spot.
