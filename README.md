# odin-recipes

This is my repository for the first project in my Odin Project journey - Recipes

It includes a home page with a list of 3 of my favorite recipes. Each item is linked to their
own page that includes a photo of the recipe, a short description, list of ingredients, and steps to
make the food.

Hope you like the website, and hopefully you are able to enjoy some of the dishes that are laid out
for you!
